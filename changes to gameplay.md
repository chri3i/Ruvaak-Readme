# The video game has been modified

Almost every aspect of vanilla gameplay in Ruvaak has been changed in some way. If something feels different from the vanilla game, it's almost certainly intentional and is not a bug. This document details the major changes that are present in the list along with mods that you should know about going into playing this list.

- *Note: This list is not exhaustive. Many other components to the list are not listed here deliberatly so that you can find them out.*

## Gameplay


## Perma Death (Rouge Like mechanic)

- Perma Death is now a fully integrated part of the list. You can disable it by going into the MCM (name TBD) and set the chance to 0


Ruvaak uses [Ordii](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55200) as its perk overhaul. This is a slightly tweaked version of Ordinator which allows for skill caps of over 100 and uses Vokrii's skill scaling.

Various other gameplay mods used include:

1. [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) drastically changes how pacing in the game is done. Rather than only getting experience on skill level ups, you now gain experience level for completing quests and killing enemies.

3. [Phylogeny - Races of Tamriel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44371) removes most racial powers in favor of new passives. Passives apply to npcs as well as the player.

4. [Nightmare Night - Renaissance of Werebeasts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60751) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s Werewolf system designed to balance existing Werewolf mechanics and add powerful new lycanthropic abilities to the game. This is used alongside [Simple Werewolf Favourite Howls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35736) to provide a consistent experience across both vampire lords and werebeasts.

5. [Enhanced Vampirism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61029) to overhaul the Vampire gameplay in a minimalistic but lore-friendly way. This will be subject to change but undecided yet

6. [Heim - Smithing Tweaks and Lightweight Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54207) provides an overhaul to smithing with minimal edits to ensure compatibility. You will need to find forging manuals in order to unlock each respective category in the forge menu.

7. [Open World Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681) changes loot and encounter zones to provide an open world and immersive experience, letting the player have a sense of progression as well as obtaining believable and balanced loots throughout your adventure and exploration. 

8. [Menhir - Standing Stones of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59927) greatly changes the effects and appearance of the standing stones.

9. [Dragon War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310) changes dragons so that they feel like a true boss fight, with a range of new attacks and abilities. Expect dragons to offer a true battle to remember.

10. [Powerful Potions and Poisons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32999) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s alchemy to make potions and poisons far more powerful. It comes with some downsides as it also introduces **permanent stat debuffs that can only be cured with a cure poison potion (note that this debuffs are hidden)**. To avoid the worst debuffs, just don't eat ingredients to learn the effects. This is coupled with [BA Alchemist Arsenal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42030) and other mods to open up many new playstyles with alchemical items.


## Magic Mods

Ruvaak doesn't come with huge magic overhauls, but those in the list, have a huge impact.

1. [Triumvirate - Mage Archetypes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39170) adds new mage archetypes to the game.

2. [Forgotten Magic Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12711) adds a few very powerful spells to the game which are possible to further enhance with perks unique to each spell.

3. [Odin - Skyrim Magic Overhaul ](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000) is what magic in Skyrim should have been. It improves and fixes vanilla Skyrim spells, makes scrolls and staves viable, and adds new spells, scrolls and staves inspired by previous Elder Scrolls magic. The new content is balanced and seamlessly integrated into the game.

4. [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s enchanting system designed to balance existing enchantments and add powerful new weapon and armor enchantments to the game. 

5. [The Path of Transcendence - Lichdom](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25654)  is a light-weight lichdom mod designed to compliment many other Necromancy themed Mods such as Ordinator's necromancy

6. [Spell Tutor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45275) is a highly adjustable mod for spell learning. Select conditions and method for learning. Keep or destroy the book. Unlearn already known spell and more. Check out the mod page and the MCM of it to learn more


## Combat Mods

Ruvaak completely reworks combat to be more action based and heavily 3rd person focused. For the combat setup I used this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=645W6WRrZ_4). While it shares similarities with Souls games (so do action based games since Zelda Ocarina of Time), it is by no means meant to replicate it!

1. [Sovngarde Beckons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64128) provides to many changes to combat to list here. I highly recommend checking out the mod page. Feel free to adjust anything in its MCM.

2. [Seamless Combat Camera](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53856) changes how the combat camera works. Ruvaak is designed for 3rd person combat and this mod forces the camera into 3rd person view. You can disable it in MO2 to play in 1st person, but you will miss out on everything i overhauled about combat.

3. [Attack Behavior Revamp](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45378) introduces attack commitment, so you can't freely turn around during attacks. The same is true for NPCs. It also gives you the ability to chains dual weapon attacks and left handed attacks.

4.  [CGO Stripped](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60258) is a leight weight alternative to the popular CGO mod. This mod allows jumping attacks and it also introduces leaning while moving (adjustable in the MCM).

5. [Action Based Projectiles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54611) tweaks the speed of projectiles in games so you can actually dodge the enemy range attacks like any modern action combat game.

6. [Wait your Turn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66243) is a lightweight combat add-on mod that adds circling behaviour to enemies. Now, group combat is more fair and fun for the player, as enemies will no longer attack all at once without a pattern. 

7. [Paulicus Poison Block (PPB) Updated](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51046) is a small, immersive mod that allows the player and NPCs to block incoming poison damage and disease effects when successfully blocking with a shield/weapon or ward spell.

## Quest and Encounter Mods

Ruvaak comes with a wide variety of new quest and encounters. A few are listed below.

1. [Nightbringer - Grim Reaper Enemy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14691) Adds a 'Grim Reaper'-inspired enemy to the game that will hunt you starting at level 19.

2. [HeadHunter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51847) expands bounty quests for Bandits, Forsworn, Giants and Dragons. Like in the Witcher 3, you can bring "trophies" from your enemy to the Jarl as proof of the bounty or deliver the captured bandits to a guard for justice.

3. [TDF Equipment Restriction](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22830) adds skill requirements to weapons, armors and spells so you can't get lucky and use the ebony axe you found somewhere at level 1. Highly adjustable in its MCM.

4. [Rogue-Like Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23872), [Coven - A witch overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51596), [Heritage Enemies 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55989) and [High Level Enemies Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32801) form the core of the expanded enemy system. Encounters will no longer be simple affiars, with a larger variety of bandits and more of them. Expect the unexpected.

5. [Open World Bosses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6117) adds a few MMO-Like creatures into the game. Don't expect to stand a chance against them early on.

6. [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576) adds a large number of localized radiant quests found at Missive Boards of varying difficulty and with varying rewards. 

7. [The Sinister Seven](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19178) assures you, that you are not alone in the world and somebody is after your character

## Expanded Cities Towns and Villages

Ruvaak is relatively easy in terms of city overhauls but it adds a few new settlements as well.

1. [Enhanced Town and Cities - ETaC](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13552) is used as the city overhaul of choice, further enhanced by mods like [Illustrious Whiterun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28950) and [Northfire's Windhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44099)

2. [Settlements Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7777) expands various locations throughout Skyrim by adding NPCs and buidings to them.

3. [More Bandit Camps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1994) ensures that not only friendly NPCs have expanded their settlements

## New Lands and Quests

While Ruvaak is focused on enhancing what is in the base game, we also have a few additions.

1. [Land of Vominheim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31472) *"A thousand years ago there was a powerful necromancer named Vuldur who lived in Vominheim. Together with his cultist group they ruled over the island with force and intimidation until one day a young nord prince Valdgar stood up and wage war against them. Eventually Vuldur and his group were defeated and they retreated to another realm."*

2. [A lot of dungeon mods from this author](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3591326) there are too many to list them, but I'm quite a fan of this mod author and the amount of dungeons from them reflects that.

3. [Darkend](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10423) "Travel to the new island of Pharos, explore detailed environments, fight new enemies and discover an Ancient set of weapons of incredible power. No quest, no holding hand, heavily inspired by The Demon's/Dark Souls games."

4. [Clockwork](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4155) is a quest mod involving a castle high in the Velothi Mountains, lost to the world for over a hundred years. Once found, you may call Clockwork Castle home... but if you want to leave, you'll need to discover how to escape.

5. [Inconvenient Dungeons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66784) removes or otherwise alters many backexits from Vanilla dungeons.

## Followers

Skyrim can be a lonely place, and the battles can be tough. Thankfully, there are a few new followers that are ready and willing to carry your burdens without complaining about them.

1. [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035) is a fully voiced Imperial follower with around 3000 lines of immersive, lore-friendly dialogue. Though he arrives in Skyrim as a cowardly scholar, he'll gradually gain strength and confidence by your side until he grows into a hero in his own right.

2. [Lucifer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44967) is a fully voiced Argonian follower with over 5K lines of dialogue and custom built features. Despite his unnatural voice for an Argonian, he is a skilled fighter. Gain his trust and he will share what he knows about himself as he doesn't know who he really is, even though he may disagree with some of your actions, he won't leave your side. 

3. [Gladys the Corgi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50164). Feel as though there's not enough dogs in Skyrim? Well now you can have your own unique corgi which will happily bite the heels of your enemies!

4. [Merlin the Corgi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56433). Still not enough corgi in your Skyrim? Well then you'll want to take this loveable and magical pup on the road with you! A unique combat-oriented corgi follower that will be sure to set your enemies ablaze with glee!

5. [Kaldus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58358) is a unique follower with a rather unique appearance. 

## Music and Weather

A modlist wouldn't be complete without a few new soundtracks and a weather upgrade. Ruvaak utilises a few mods to help achieve that whilst still keeping the iconic soundtrack that we all know and love.

1. [Aequinoctium - Weathers and Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15884) is the weather mod of choice for Ruvaak. Pairing with the ENB perfectly, it provides the perfect backdrop for the list.

2. [Personalized Music](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2572) + [Dark Era](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39746) provide the music to give the feeling i was going for with the list

3. [Audio Overhaul Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466) does what it pretty much says on the tin. Expect sounds to feel more relistic and, well, overhauled.

4. [Immersive Sounds Compendium](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/523) provides a dramatic and marked update to many of the sounds in the game. This is merged with AOS to create the perfect overhaul to the sounds in game.

## Survival & Immersion

Ruvaak is by no means a heavily roleplaying focused list but there are some mods that make it possible on a pretty basic level.

1. [CC Survival mode](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Survival_Mode) is further enhanced by mods like [Conner's Survival Mode](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19152), [Survival Control Panel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41891), [Sleep under the Stars](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20548) and [Frost Resist provides Warmth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61272)

2. [CC Camping](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Camping) lets you build basic campsides. It works with Survival mode turned off as well in case you don't like survival elements but still want to build campsites.

3. [Pick your Poison](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23710) gives you books that list the alchemical ingredients and their effects.

4. [Natural Character Growth and Decay](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26292) makes it so Health, Magicka, Stamina and Carry Weight will naturally grow according to your playstyle independent of level or skills. It's highly adjustable in its MCM and you can even turn on the vanilla attributes on top of it in its MCM (not advised though, as you'll end up with pretty high attributes early on)

5. [Honed Metal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61015) Blacksmiths and mages all over Skyrim will be able to craft, temper and enchant your equipment, including armor and weapons added by mods. The quality and price of their work will depend on their skill as craftsmen as well as your barter abilities. Fully customizable through an MCM menu.

6. [Breakable Equipment System](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23686) does what the name suggests. It is disabled by default in its MCM to enable it, simply load the 'Ruvaak' profile there. Make sure to read the mod page first to fully understand its features.

 ## **IMPORTANT REMINDER ABOUT INGREDIENTS** - Do NOT eat them to find out the effects, they will give you stackable permanent debuffs
