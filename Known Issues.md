### Known Issues

I can't fix any of those as of now expect the level ranges but this will take time, a lot of time!

- Enemies are way outside the expected level range. I might make some adjustments but overall I'm ok with that.
- Nighteye looks grey. Doesn't look good but at least it works. I don't really know how to change that and every attempt i made borked it completely. Grey it is!
- When rapid fire is on. Sometimes the bow draws in slow motion. The fix is toggling it off and on again.
- Nighteye doesn't work with the latest default ENB. I leave it at that as it's easy to swap ENBs if you really need the night eye. Nothing i can do about it other than using a different ENB
